I wish I knew assembler but I am not fluent in x86 so I decided to write in python instead. 
My raison dâ€™etre was to learn and use exceptions. 


I learnt forth a while back. I have implemented it a few times and I was never satisfied 
with my creation. Writing in python brings its own challenges. Its also a good way to test 
understanding. Nothing beats watching your creation run through tests and compute.

You may never use forth as its no longer as popular but I hope you will gain a new understanding.
